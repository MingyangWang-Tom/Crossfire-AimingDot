Overview: 
The Aiming Dot Controller is a simple GUI utility designed to help FPS gamers with aiming. By providing a customizable dot overlay on the screen, players can achieve better game accuracy and precision. This tool is especially beneficial for games or scenarios where there's no native crosshair or aiming reticle. Feel free to download and change the source code to fit your style, or you could simply download the .exe file to use the app.

How to Use: 
Positioning: Use the "Dot X Coordinate" and "Dot Y Coordinate" fields to adjust the dot's position, by default, the dot is in the center of the screen.
Choose Color: Click on the "Choose Color" button to pick a color for the dot.
Adjust Size: Use the slider to adjust the size of the dot.
Show Dot: Click on the "Show Dot" button to display the dot on the screen.
Exit: Click on the "Exit" button to close the application.

Limitations: 
The dot might not always be visible on top in certain full-screen games. For best results, use in windowed or borderless windowed mode.
Ensure you're adhering to the game's terms of service when using this tool, as some games might not allow third-party overlays.
