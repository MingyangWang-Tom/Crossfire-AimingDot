## Overview

The Aiming Dot Controller is a simple GUI utility designed to help FPS gamers with aiming. By providing a customizable dot overlay on the screen, players can achieve better game accuracy and precision. This tool is especially beneficial for games or scenarios where there's no native crosshair or aiming reticle. Feel free to download and change the source code (for personal use only) to fit your style, or you could simply download the .exe file to use the app.

## How to Use

### Positioning

Use the "Dot X Coordinate" and "Dot Y Coordinate" fields to adjust the dot's position. By default, the dot is in the center of the screen.

### Choose Color

Click on the "Choose Color" button to pick a color for the dot.

### Adjust Size

Use the slider to adjust the size of the dot.

### Show Dot

Click on the "Show Dot" button to display the dot on the screen.

### Exit

Click on the "Exit" button to close the application.

## Beta Feature

### Enable/disable Right-Click Hide

When the user clicks and holds the right mouse button, the dot will disappear.

## Limitations

1. The dot might not always be visible on top in certain full-screen games. For best results, use in windowed or borderless windowed mode.
2. This is not a hack, so do not expect the dot to trace the recoil.
3. Ensure you're adhering to the game's terms of service when using this tool, as some games might not allow third-party overlays.
